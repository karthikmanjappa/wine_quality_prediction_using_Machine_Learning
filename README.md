### Project Title : 
#### Wine quality prediction using machine_learning
### Project Description :  
#### This datasets is related to predict the quality of wine .The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.i will predict the quality of the wine.
### Building predictive models for wine quality It Shown In The Heat Map:

### Color scale:
#### Dark red indicates a strong positive correlation (closer to 1).
#### Dark blue indicates a strong negative correlation (closer to -1).
#### Lighter shades indicate weaker correlations.
### Target variable (quality):
#### Alcohol has the highest positive correlation with wine quality (0.44). This suggests that wines with higher alcohol content tend to have higher quality ratings.
#### Sulphates (0.25) and citric acid (0.09) also show some positive correlations with quality, but these are weaker.
### Strong correlations between other features:
#### Free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide have a strong positive correlation (0.72). These variables are related as they both measure sulfur compounds used to preserve wine.
#### Density and alcohol have a strong negative correlation (-0.69), meaning that denser wines tend to have lower alcohol content.
### final Accuracy :

#### The accuracy of the SVC model is 0.74, or about 74.08%. This means that the SVC model correctly classified approximately 74% of the wine quality labels in the test set.
### Conclusion:
#### wine quality prediction, consider emphasizing the importance of using a combination of domain knowledge and advanced machine learning techniques. While models can identify patterns in data, understanding the chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, and sugar levels, can greatly enhance model performance. Additionally, it is essential to continuously validate the model against real-world data and use explainable AI methods to ensure the predictions are interpretable for winemakers and industry stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to create a model that not only predicts wine quality accurately but also provides actionable insights for improving wine production processes.
