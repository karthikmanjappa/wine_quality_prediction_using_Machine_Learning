# Project Title : 
### Wine quality prediction using machine learning
# Project Description :  
#### This datasets is related to predict the quality of wine .The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is highly imbalanced.i will predict the quality of the wine.
